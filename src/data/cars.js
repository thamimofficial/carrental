    drivingFeel:
      "With 1,001 HP split between a naturally aspirated V12 and three electric motors, this Revuelto doesn't drive like a conventional supercar. The electric motors bolted on to the front axle mean the throttle response feels immediate, even when the V12 has not yet fully spun up."

    drivingFeel:
      "The hybrid-assisted V8 blends immediate low-rev torque fill from its electric assistance with the deep growl of Bentley's twin-turbo V8, reaching 100 km/h in 3.4 seconds through an all-wheel-drive system built for year-round use. With the roof down it settles into effortless high-speed cruising, and with it up, wind and road noise stay remarkably well suppressed for a convertible."
